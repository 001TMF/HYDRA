# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-18)

**Core value:** The agent loop must reliably detect model degradation, diagnose root causes, generate and test improvement hypotheses, and promote better models -- all without human intervention.
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Data Infrastructure + Options Math Engine

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (Data Infrastructure + Options Math Engine)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Five-phase structure following strict data-flow dependencies; two hard validation gates after Phase 1 (options math stability) and Phase 2 (signal predictive power)
- [Roadmap]: Phase 4 flagged for deeper research before planning (LLM structured output reliability, prompt engineering, mutation playbook design)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1]: Data vendor selection not yet finalized -- Databento vs. CME DataMine vs. IB historical needs hands-on evaluation
- [Phase 1]: Target market selection (oats vs. lean hogs vs. ethanol) depends on which has sufficient options chain data

## Session Continuity
